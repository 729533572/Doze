Doze

Doze is a lightweight Android app that allows you to specify a time for your phone to doze off and a time for it to wake up again.  Dozing off can mean turning off the radio connections, or just silencing the calls and emails.

Doze allows you to use your phone as an alarm clock without waking you with night-time emails.  With Doze you can stop your phone ringing during a meeting or class, knowing that it will automatically turn on again afterwards.

Once doze off and wake up times are set, Doze will remember and repeat every day.  When it is set, Doze will close, then will restart at the appropriate moment.  Doze does not remain running when it's not needed.
